# Automatic-File-Organizer
The project is a file organization script that helps keep your directories clean and organized. It scans a specified directory (or multiple directories) for files with different extensions (e.g., .csv, .xlsx, .png, .txt, etc.) and sorts them into separate folders based on their file types.

Here's the way in order to understand the files uploaded on this repository.

* The file with the name of "Automatic_file_sorter2" contains the code of python. The code basically creates the folders where the files are going to get stored in, if they don't already exist. Then follows to check if any of the files already exist within the given directories so that they don't get overwrited. Finally, it moves the files to the respective directory depending on the extension of the file and the name of the directory.

* The "Before - Files" is an image of the directory with all the files spread around.
* The "After - csv, Excel, etc. Files" are images of the files stored in their respective folder after running the script.
* The "After Folders Image" file is an image of how the original folder with all the files spreaded, finally got cleaned.
