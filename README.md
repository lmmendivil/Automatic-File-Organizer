# Automatic-File-Organizer
The project is a file organization script that helps keep your directories clean and organized. It scans a specified directory (or multiple directories) for files with different extensions (e.g., .csv, .xlsx, .png, .txt, etc.) and sorts them into separate folders based on their file types.

This repository contains the following files to help you understand the automatic file sorting functionality:

* The file with the name of "Automatic_file_sorter2" contains the code of python. The code basically creates the folders where the files are going to get stored in, if they don't already exist. Then follows to check if any of the files already exist within the given directories so that they don't get overwritten. Finally, it moves the files to the respective directory depending on the extension of the file and the name of the folder.

* The "Before - Files.jpg" is an image that captures the initial state of the directory, where files of various types are scattered throughout the folder without any specific organization or structure.
  
* The files named "After - csv, Excel, etc. Files" are a series of images that showcase the organized state of the directory after running the automatic file sorting script. Each image represents a specific folder containing files of a particular type (e.g., CSV, Excel spreadsheets, documents, images, etc.), neatly sorted and moved into their respective folders by the script.
  
* The "After Folders Image.jpg" showcases the organized state of the original directory after the script has sorted and moved all files into their respective folders based on file extensions, resulting in a clean and structured directory.
