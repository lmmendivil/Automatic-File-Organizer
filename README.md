# Automatic-File-Organizer
The project is a file organization script that helps keep your directories clean and organized. It scans a specified directory (or multiple directories) for files with different extensions (e.g., .csv, .xlsx, .png, .txt, etc.) and sorts them into separate folders based on their file types.
